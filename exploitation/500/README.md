About us: SCP International is a new organization trying to promote safe international communication. We are pioneering new PKI technologies such as user photos instead of names to help keep international communication fun and exciting. Try it! If you are invited, try using a link to your photo instead of your 'commonName' in your certificate signing request! Also, SCP is actively recruiting interns. If you're interested please check out some of our previous intern's work on GitHub and Email us an application!
