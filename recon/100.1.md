Update from sunday:
    Judges page listed PNG file: https://ctf.isis.poly.edu/judges/photos/ataylor.png
    
    It has some text data:
    IHDR
    +tEXtThese aren't the chunks you're looking for.
    tEXtYou can go about your business.~
    tEXtMove along.K
    	pHYs
    xORkCSAW
    IDATx
    
    I'm thinking the file needs to be XOR'ed with the string 'CSAW', but I can't figure out how to do that. =/
    I tried all the utils from this page: http://computer-forensics.sans.org/blog/2013/05/14/tools-for-examining-xor-obfuscation-for-malware-analysis
    
    without luck =(

After hours of trying different things on sunday morning, I finally figured out that the bless GUI utility has a built-in XOR function that decoded the key.
