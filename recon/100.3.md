# Recon - Jordan Wiens - 100 points  

## Challenge site  

the trail starts where the trail ended  

Pulled csaw@psifertex.com PGP key from pgp.mit.edu (included in this directory).  Noticed it was extremely long for a PGP public key.

	$ gpg -a csaw\@psifertex.com.gpg   
	pub  2048R/A827D636 2013-08-08 Jordan Wiens (CSAW folks: getting warmer) <csaw@psifertex.com>  
	uid                            [jpeg image of size 6332]  
	sub  2048R/ABD7CBD4 2013-08-08 [expires: 2014-01-05]  

Noticed the uid saying jpeg image...  When we removed the top line of the key and the bottom lines and base64 decoded it there was a lot of image looking data in the hex.  Removed the front padding so that the JPEG magic number was at the beginning of the file.  From there it was a matter of viewing the image.  

    Found Michael Vario's keys on twitter: PGP 0x4b74e38aedd31e2a (https://twitter.com/mvario1)
    and gplus: PGP Fingerprint: D77E 53E2 3C99 F177 6E9B 15C5 4B74 E38A EDD3 1E2A (https://plus.google.com/104285003536194921645/about)
    
    Psifertex.com is 1080p 10hours nyancat, so this looks promising.
