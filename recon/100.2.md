## IRC hint  
<ttttt123> for the recon julian cohen puzzle got up to http://deathbycats.com/ and then stuck  

### Examine site  

Through a normal browser it is just a bunch of crazy cats, not much in the source ccode.  When connected to with netcat you get the answer.  

	$ nc deathbycats.com 80  
	GET / HTTP/1.0  

	HTTP/1.1 200 OK

As you can see the flag presents itself. My guess is that it was looking for a non-browser to request the page, but I have not narrowed down the variables to see what exactly does it.
