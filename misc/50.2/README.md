## Notes  

__Finding process:__
* packet capture with .process file is used by a modified version of wireshark 1.6.5 called PAINT, created by Digital Operatives (included)  
* this version of Wireshark adds two columns: pid and process name (scroll right in main view to see them)  
* flag is the process name sending traffic
